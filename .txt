Lynn entered the financial world after running finances for
her own small business. She recognized the struggles so many
small businesses have when trying to juggle finances and their
day-to-day tasks. So she went back to school to study
accounting, and began working with the practice shortly after.

The founder of Phill Banks Financial Consulting, Phill is
dedicated to the financial wellness of each and every business
owner who walks through the door. Phill opened his practice 10
years ago to be a knowledgeable haven for small businesses of
all stages to address their financial needs.
